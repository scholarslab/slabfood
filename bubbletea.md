# Bubble tea
## Ingredients for one serving
### Boba cookin'
Scant 1/3 cup uncooked boba aka bubbles aka tapioca pearls ([for example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007AX3ABG); a full 1/3 cup is just a little too much for 1 serving and I haven't tested whether e.g. 1/4 cup is enough)  
3 cups water, any temp  
Water in a bowl in the fridge (just needs to submerge the cooked bob in it for 20 seconds and is then drained away, so amount doesn't matter; I think I end up using 2-3 cups?)  

### Drink to contain boba
Tall glass to drink from (e.g. ~16oz glass or larger)  
Wide straw (to fit boba; normal straws won't fit them)  
I've been using a mix of regular-strength coffee (made in a drip machine and previously cooled off completely in my fridge; have been keeping a mason jar full in there), whole milk, and sometimes sugar (e.g. 1-2 tsp). I've seen many recipes have you stir the cooked boba in a bowl of sugar or honey before adding them to the drink, but I have not done this, and I usually don't add any sugar as it tastes good without it. You could also use some mixture of: concentrated cold coffee, caffeinated or herbal tea, fake milk, fruit juice, sweeteners.

## Instructions
### Boba cookin'
Put bowl of water in the fridge (it's okay if you forget and need to use water right from the tap later on; I'm not sure how much difference to texture using colder water makes, but it's turned out fine both ways)  
Boil the water  
Once boiling, add boba to the water  
Wait until most of the boba have risen to the surface (~30-60 seconds?)  
Turn down to medium heat and allow to cook for 3 minutes  
Turn off heat and leave in water over burner for 3 minutes  
Remove bowl of water from fridge  
Drain boba with colander and place cooked boba into bowl of cold water; leave there for 20 seconds  
Drain boba  
You're now ready to mix your boba into a drink!
