# Ingredients
1/2 cup olive oil  
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  
3 tablespoons tomato paste  
2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained (we don't rinse and it's fine)  
Salt and black pepper ("generous pinches" = if that's not clear enough for you, start with 1 tsp each and adjust each time you make the recipe; the goal is to have these enhance the other flavors without noticeably tasting like salt/pepper)  
1/2 pound mozzarella, coarsely grated (about 2 cups)  
Pot/pan with high sides that is oven-safe, e.g. a dutch oven  

# Steps
Preheat oven to 475 degrees (this will take longer than the other steps below, so start on those steps below right after beginning to preheat the oven)  
On the stovetop in the pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat  
Fry the garlic until it's lightly golden (about 1 minute)  
Stir in the tomato paste (be careful of splattering) and fry for 30 seconds, reducing the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from burning  
Turn off the stovetop heat
Add the beans and generous pinches of salt and pepper and stir to combine  
Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top  
Once the oven has preheated to 475 (we often need to wait a bit for that to happen, at this point), put the pot into the oven (no lid!) and bake until the cheese has melted and browned in spots (~12 minutes)  
If the top is not as toasted as youâ€™d like, run the skillet under the broiler for 1-2 minutes. Eat at once.
